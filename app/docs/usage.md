4. Click and drag on the canvas to draw.

## Erasing

2. Click and drag over the areas you want to erase.

## Adding Notes

4. Drag the note to reposition it.

## Adding Shapes

## Saving and Loading

The app automatically saves your work to local storage. When you reload the page, your previous work will be restored.

## Clearing the Canvas

To clear the entire canvas and start fresh, you can implement a clear function in the `WhiteboardContext` and add a clear button to the toolbar.

Remember that all elements (notes, shapes, and text) can be manipulated after they're added to the canvas. You can drag them around, edit their content, and delete them as needed.
